# IAM Role & Policy Authoring Rules for CI/CD and Automation

## Relationship to CI/CD Rules
These IAM authoring rules are part of the broader automation and security standards for this project. All contributors must also follow the organization-wide CI/CD and automation best practices defined in [.cicdrules.md](.cicdrules.md). For OIDC integration with GitHub Actions, see section 2.12 of `global_rules.md` and ensure the OIDC role policy is reviewed and updated as needed.

A comprehensive guide for creating, refining, and maintaining AWS IAM roles and policies for CI/CD pipelines, automation, and least-privilege security.

## 1. **Start with Official AWS References**
- Use AWS's [least-privilege policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_examples.html) and [service action lists](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html) for each AWS service you automate.
- For CloudFormation automation, begin with [recommended permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html#using-iam-template-actions).

## 2. **Iterative Policy Development**
- **Initial Development:**
  - Grant broad permissions (e.g., `cloudformation:*`, `resiliencehub:*`) to the automation role for rapid prototyping.
  - Document the rationale and the intent to tighten permissions later.
- **Refinement:**
  - After successful runs, use CloudTrail and IAM Access Analyzer to generate a least-privilege policy based on actual API calls.
  - Replace the broad policy with the synthesized least-privilege policy.

## 3. **IAM Access Analyzer Workflow**
1. Grant the automation role broad permissions.
2. Run the workflow end-to-end.
3. In the AWS Console, use IAM Access Analyzer to generate a policy from CloudTrail activity for that role.
4. Review and apply the generated policy, replacing the broad permissions.
5. Re-run the workflow to validate.

## 4. **Common Gotchas & Best Practices**
- **CloudFormation Deploy:** Requires not just stack actions but also `CreateChangeSet`, `ExecuteChangeSet`, `DescribeChangeSet`, `ListChangeSets`, etc.
- **Resource Scoping:** Use `"Resource": "*"` for CI/CD roles unless you have a strong reason to scope tighter; this avoids resource ARN mismatches.
- **Policy Propagation:** After updating a policy, wait up to a minute for IAM changes to propagate before re-testing.
- **Review Cycles:** Schedule periodic reviews of IAM policies using Access Analyzer and CloudTrail to remove unused permissions.
- **Document Everything:** For each policy, document why each action is needed and when it was last reviewed.

## 5. **Security Principles**
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant the permissions required for automation tasks.
- **Separation of Duties:** Use dedicated roles for CI/CD, not personal or admin roles.
- **No Wildcard Admin in Production:** Never use `AdministratorAccess` for production automation.
- **Monitor & Alert:** Enable CloudTrail and configure alerts for denied actions and suspicious activity.

- [AWS IAM Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-generation.html)
- [AWS Service Authorization Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html)

## 7. **Sample Policy Creation Workflow**
1. Draft policy with all actions needed for your automation use case.
2. Apply and test in a non-production environment.
3. Use CloudTrail/IAM Access Analyzer to synthesize a minimal policy.
4. Replace the draft with the minimal policy.
5. Document and schedule regular reviews.

---

## 8. **Proactive Permission Management from Infrastructure as Code**

- **Analyze all CloudFormation, Terraform, or serverless templates for required IAM actions using tools like [Policy Sentry](https://github.com/salesforce/policy_sentry).**
- **Integrate policy analysis into your CI/CD pipeline** to alert if new or changed resources require additional permissions.
- **Before merging any PR that adds or modifies AWS resources,** compare the generated required actions to the current automation role policy.
- **Update this file and the IAM policy as needed.** Every IAM policy change must be documented here and referenced in the relevant pull request (PR).
- **Reference this process in PR templates and documentation** for every infrastructure change. For GitHub Actions OIDC integration, always review and update the OIDC role policy per the latest standards (see `global_rules.md` section 2.12).

### Example Workflow
| Step         | Tool/Practice     | Outcome                                  |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Edit IaC     | Policy Sentry     | Generate required IAM actions             |
| Review/PR    | Manual/Automated  | Compare actions to role policy            |
| CI/CD        | Linting/Checks    | Alert on missing permissions              |
| Documentation| Reference rules   | Ensures team awareness and compliance     |

#### Checklist for Contributors
- [ ] Have you run Policy Sentry (or equivalent) on all new/changed IaC?
- [ ] For any GitHub Actions OIDC integration, have you reviewed and updated the OIDC role policy as described in `global_rules.md` section 2.12?
- [ ] Have you compared required IAM actions to the OIDC role policy?
- [ ] Have you updated `.iamrolerules.md` and the role policy if needed?
- [ ] Have you referenced this process and any IAM policy changes in your PR?

**Following these rules will ensure your automation roles are secure, auditable, and maintainable, while minimizing permission errors and security risk.**
