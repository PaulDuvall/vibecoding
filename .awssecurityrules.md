# AWS Security Best Practices (MECE)

## 1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the permissions required for each user, group, and role.  
  - [IAM Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)
- **Use IAM Roles, Not Root:** Never use the AWS root account for daily tasks. Use roles and MFA for all privileged access.
- **Enable MFA:** Require multi-factor authentication for all users, especially privileged accounts.
- **Rotate Credentials:** Regularly rotate access keys and passwords.
- **Monitor IAM Activity:** Use AWS CloudTrail and IAM Access Analyzer to detect unusual activity or privilege escalation.

## 2. Detective Controls
- **Enable AWS CloudTrail:** Record all API activity across all regions and accounts.
- **Enable AWS Config:** Continuously monitor and record resource configurations.
- **Use GuardDuty, Security Hub, and Inspector:** Continuously analyze logs and configurations for threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Centralize Logging:** Aggregate logs in a secure, immutable S3 bucket and analyze with Amazon Athena or a SIEM.

## 3. Infrastructure Protection
- **Network Segmentation:** Use VPCs, subnets, and security groups to isolate workloads.
- **Restrict Inbound/Outbound Traffic:** Use NACLs, Security Groups, and AWS Firewall Manager to enforce least privilege at the network layer.
- **Use AWS Shield and WAF:** Protect against DDoS and web application attacks.
- **Patch Management:** Regularly update and patch EC2 instances, containers, and managed services.

## 4. Data Protection
- **Encrypt Data at Rest and in Transit:** Use AWS KMS, S3 default encryption, EBS encryption, and enforce TLS for all connections.
- **Manage Keys Securely:** Rotate and control access to encryption keys using KMS and Secrets Manager.
- **Backup and Versioning:** Enable S3 versioning, RDS snapshots, and cross-region backups.
- **Classify and Tag Sensitive Data:** Use Macie and resource tagging to identify and protect sensitive data.

## 5. Incident Response
- **Prepare Incident Response Plans:** Define, document, and regularly test your incident response procedures.
- **Automate Response:** Use Lambda, CloudWatch Events, and Systems Manager Automation for rapid response.
- **Forensics Readiness:** Ensure logs are immutable and retained for investigation.

## 6. Service-Specific Security Best Practices
- **Review AWS Service Security Guides:** Each AWS service has its own best practices (search: `AWS <service> security best practices site:docs.aws.amazon.com`).

    - [RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html)
    - [Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/best-practices.html)
    - [CodePipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/security-best-practices.html)

    - [VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Security.html)
    - [CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesSecurity)
    - [SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/security.html)
    - ...and [more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/).

## 7. Organizational & Governance Controls
- **Use AWS Organizations:** Centrally manage accounts, apply Service Control Policies (SCPs), and enforce guardrails.
- **Enable Security Hub & Trusted Advisor:** Continuously monitor for compliance and security best practices.
- **Automate Compliance Checks:** Use AWS Config rules, Security Hub, and custom Lambda functions.
- **Implement Change Management:** Use CloudFormation, CodePipeline, and version control for infrastructure as code.

## 8. Support & Continuous Improvement
- **Leverage AWS Support:** Use AWS Support plans for expert guidance and incident response.  
  - [Getting Started with AWS Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/getting-started.html)
- **Stay Current:** Subscribe to the [AWS Security Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/) and monitor new guidance.
- **Participate in Security Reviews:** Regularly review your architecture with AWS Well-Architected Tool and security assessments.
