# **AI Engineering – Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **Overview**

**AI Engineering** is an automated content aggregation and summarization platform that delivers curated email digests and web content focused on AI Engineering tools, practices, and developments. More than just content curation, it serves as a living showcase of AI-powered development by transparently building itself with AI tools like Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, and demonstrating the meta-practice of "building with AI to teach AI Engineering."

Designed for developers transitioning to AI Engineering roles, it provides tool comparisons, implementation patterns, and step-by-step guidance on becoming an AI Engineer.

---

## **Problem Statement**

The rapid evolution of AI development tools and practices creates a knowledge gap for traditional software engineers wanting to become AI Engineers. Critical insights are scattered across tool documentation, community forums, and disparate newsletters. Developers need practical guidance on:

- **Tool Selection**: Cursor vs. Windsurf vs. Claude Code vs. Copilot
- **AI Engineering Patterns**: Prompt-driven development, human-in-the-loop workflows
- **Implementation Examples**: Real code, prompts, and results from actual AI-assisted builds

**AI Engineering** solves this by providing curated content, tool comparisons, and transparent "behind-the-build" documentation showing how the platform itself is built with AI tools.

## **Technical Architecture**

### 🧱 System Components

| Component        | Responsibility                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GitHub Actions` | Orchestrates daily runs at 9 AM ET, handles logging & errors                   |
| `vibe_digest.py` | Core script for data fetch, summarization, HTML generation, and email dispatch |
| `tests/`         | Unit tests, mock inputs, linting (PEP8 + pylint)                               |
| `DynamoDB/Aurora`| Stores daily digests with date-keyed records                                   |
| `Lambda/API`     | CRUD endpoints for inserting and retrieving digests                            |
| `Web UI`         | “History” page to display past digests                                         |

#### Data Persistence Architecture Notes

- **AWS Service**: Use DynamoDB (preferred for serverless, scalable, and high-durability needs) or Aurora if relational features are required.
- **Table Design**: Table keyed by `date` (YYYY-MM-DD). Attributes: `feed_source`, `title`, `url`, `summary`, `timestamp`.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /digest` (Lambda): Insert new daily digest records
  - `GET /digest/{date}` (Lambda): Retrieve digest by date
  - `GET /digest` (Lambda): List digests over a date range
- **Web UI**: “History” page fetches and displays digests by date, with fast query and rendering.
- **Security**: Apply least-privilege IAM roles for Lambda access. Enable point-in-time recovery for DynamoDB.

### 🚀 Performance Architecture

**Advanced Async Processing Pipeline:**
- **Async/Await Implementation**: Full non-blocking I/O with `asyncio` and `aiohttp`
- **Concurrent Summarization**: Up to 10 simultaneous OpenAI API requests with semaphore control
- **Smart Content Batching**: Groups similar articles by domain for coherent summaries
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Dynamic adjustment based on API response headers
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics tracking cost, latency, and cache hit rates

**Expected Performance Gains:**
- **3-5x faster processing** compared to thread-based concurrency
- **30-40% cost reduction** through token optimization and model selection
- **20-30% quality improvement** for related articles through smart batching
- **Zero rate limit errors** via proactive adaptive throttling
