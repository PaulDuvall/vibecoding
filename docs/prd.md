# **AI Engineering – Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **Overview**

**AI Engineering** is an automated content aggregation and summarization platform that delivers curated email digests and web content focused on AI Engineering tools, practices, and developments. More than just content curation, it serves as a living showcase of AI-powered development by transparently building itself with AI tools like Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, and demonstrating the meta-practice of "building with AI to teach AI Engineering."

Designed for developers transitioning to AI Engineering roles, it provides tool comparisons, implementation patterns, and step-by-step guidance on becoming an AI Engineer.

## **Problem Statement**

AI Engineering is **not about inventing neural networks—it's about integrating existing foundation models into production systems**. The fundamental shift is:

- **Traditional ML**: Data → Model → Product  
- **Modern AI Engineering**: Product Value → Prototype → Data & Model

**The Challenge:** DevOps and software engineers have the exact skills needed for AI Engineering (CI/CD, IaC, monitoring, systems thinking) but don't realize how directly transferable their expertise is. They need practical guidance on:

- **Skills Transfer**: How CI/CD applies to model deployment and evaluation
- **Tool Integration**: MLOps/LLMOps pipelines with existing DevOps tools  
- **Production Patterns**: Prompt versioning, model monitoring, inference optimization
- **Authority-Driven Learning**: Insights from AI Engineering experts like Chip Huyen

**AI Engineering** solves this by providing curated content, tool comparisons, and transparent "behind-the-build" documentation showing how DevOps principles apply to AI systems.

## **Primary Audience: DevOps Engineers Becoming AI Engineers**

**Core Insight**: "*AI engineering is the next evolution of a great software or DevOps engineer*" - Industry Expert

**Your DevOps Skills Are Your AI Engineering Superpowers:**
- **CI/CD & Automation** → Model testing, versioning, and deployment pipelines
- **Infrastructure as Code** → GPU fleets, vector databases, serverless endpoints
- **Version Control** → Prompt versioning, dataset management, model configurations  
- **Monitoring & Observability** → Model quality, data drift, token costs
- **Systems Thinking** → End-to-end AI system design and optimization

## **Technical Architecture**

### 🧱 System Components

| Component        | Responsibility                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GitHub Actions` | Orchestrates daily runs at 9 AM ET, handles logging & errors                   |
| `vibe_digest.py` | Core script for data fetch, summarization, HTML generation, and email dispatch |
| `tests/`         | Unit tests, mock inputs, linting (PEP8 + pylint)                               |
| `DynamoDB/Aurora`| Stores daily digests with date-keyed records                                   |
| `Lambda/API`     | CRUD endpoints for inserting and retrieving digests                            |
| `Web UI`         | “History” page to display past digests                                         |

#### Data Persistence Architecture Notes

- **AWS Service**: Use DynamoDB (preferred for serverless, scalable, and high-durability needs) or Aurora if relational features are required.
- **Table Design**: Table keyed by `date` (YYYY-MM-DD). Attributes: `feed_source`, `title`, `url`, `summary`, `timestamp`.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /digest` (Lambda): Insert new daily digest records
  - `GET /digest/{date}` (Lambda): Retrieve digest by date
  - `GET /digest` (Lambda): List digests over a date range
- **Web UI**: “History” page fetches and displays digests by date, with fast query and rendering.
- **Security**: Apply least-privilege IAM roles for Lambda access. Enable point-in-time recovery for DynamoDB.

### 🚀 Performance Architecture

**Advanced Async Processing Pipeline:**
- **Async/Await Implementation**: Full non-blocking I/O with `asyncio` and `aiohttp`
- **Concurrent Summarization**: Up to 10 simultaneous OpenAI API requests with semaphore control
- **Smart Content Batching**: Groups similar articles by domain for coherent summaries
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Dynamic adjustment based on API response headers
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics tracking cost, latency, and cache hit rates

**Expected Performance Gains:**
- **3-5x faster processing** compared to thread-based concurrency
- **30-40% cost reduction** through token optimization and model selection
- **20-30% quality improvement** for related articles through smart batching
- **Zero rate limit errors** via proactive adaptive throttling
