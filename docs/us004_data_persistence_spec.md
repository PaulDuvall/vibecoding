# Data Persistence of Digests Specification {#data_persistence}

## Overview {#overview}
This specification defines the data persistence system for the Vibe Coding Digest, establishing the contract for storing and retrieving daily digest summaries in AWS DynamoDB.

**Strategic Goals:**
- Reliable storage of daily digest summaries
- Historical digest retrieval capabilities
- Graceful degradation during database failures
- Cost-effective and scalable data storage
- Security and compliance adherence

## Definitions {#definitions}

**Digest**: A daily collection of summarized articles from configured RSS feeds and sources  
**Digest Item**: An individual article within a digest containing title, URL, summary, and metadata  
**Persistence**: The process of storing digest data in a durable database  
**Digest Date**: The date (YYYY-MM-DD) when a digest was generated and sent  
**Item ID**: A unique identifier for each digest item within a date (source#timestamp#hash)  
**Batch Operation**: Writing multiple items to the database in a single request  
**Feature Flag**: A configuration toggle to enable/disable persistence functionality  

## Persistence Requirements {#persistence_requirements authority=system}

### Data Storage {#data_storage authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Store each digest item with a date key (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Include feed source, title, URL, summary, and timestamp for each item
- Generate unique item IDs to prevent duplicate storage
- Support batch operations for digests with 25+ items
- Complete persistence operations within 30 seconds
- Maintain data durability of at least 99.9%

### Schema Structure {#schema_structure authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Use digest_date as the partition key (String type)
- Use item_id as the sort key (String type)
- Store feed_source, title, url, summary, and timestamp as required fields
- Support additional metadata fields for extensibility
- Implement a SourceIndex GSI for source-based queries

### Error Handling {#error_handling authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Continue digest generation even if persistence fails
- Retry failed operations up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- Log all persistence failures to CloudWatch
- Send email digests regardless of persistence outcome
- Trigger alerts for persistence failure rates exceeding 5%

### Security Controls {#security_controls authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Use least-privilege IAM policies for DynamoDB access
- Enable encryption at rest for all stored data
- Implement point-in-time recovery for data protection
- Audit all database operations in CloudWatch logs
- Restrict access to specific table and index resources

## Retrieval Requirements {#retrieval_requirements authority=system}

### Query Operations {#query_operations authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Retrieve complete digests by date within 5 seconds
- Return all items for a requested date with proper sorting
- Handle requests for non-existent dates gracefully
- Support pagination for large result sets
- Provide empty responses for future dates

### Data Validation {#data_validation authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Validate required fields before storage
- Log invalid items without blocking valid ones
- Update existing items when duplicate URLs are detected
- Generate data quality metrics for monitoring
- Continue processing despite validation failures

## Performance Requirements {#performance_requirements authority=platform}

### Scalability {#scalability authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Handle digests with 200+ items efficiently
- Maintain memory usage below 512MB during processing
- Use batch operations to minimize API calls
- Support concurrent read/write operations
- Scale automatically with digest volume growth

### Monitoring {#monitoring authority=platform}
The system MUST:
- Publish custom CloudWatch metrics for success/failure rates
- Track latency for all database operations
- Create dashboards showing daily storage statistics
- Generate cost optimization reports
- Alert on anomalous usage patterns

## Configuration Management {#configuration authority=system}

### Environment Variables {#env_vars authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Support ENABLE_PERSISTENCE flag for feature toggling
- Configure AWS_REGION for database location
- Set DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME for table identification
- Define PERSISTENCE_BATCH_SIZE for batch operations
- Specify PERSISTENCE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS for resilience

### Feature Flags {#feature_flags authority=system}
The system MUST:
- Allow disabling persistence without code changes
- Log when persistence is skipped due to configuration
- Maintain backward compatibility when disabled
- Support gradual rollout capabilities
- Enable A/B testing of persistence features
