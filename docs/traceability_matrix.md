|--------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|-------|
| US-XXX       | [Secret scanning must be enforced in CI/CD using an automated tool] | .github/workflows/vibe-coding-digest.yml | N/A | Gitleaks scan job blocks workflow on secret detection; see .cicdrules.md |

## CI/CD Security Controls

- **Automated secrets scanning** is implemented using Gitleaks in the GitHub Actions workflow ([`.github/workflows/vibe-coding-digest.yml`](../.github/workflows/vibe-coding-digest.yml)), per `.cicdrules.md` requirements.
- If secrets are found, the workflow fails and downstream jobs are blocked.
- This control satisfies the "build quality in" and security automation requirements outlined in `.cicdrules.md`.
