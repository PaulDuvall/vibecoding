## I. Foundational Principles & Culture

### US-200: Build Quality In
**As** a developer,
**I want** to proactively build quality into the product from the start,
**So that** defects are caught early and not left for downstream inspection.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Automated tests, linters, and secret scans run locally and in CI (see `.cicdrules.md` §I.1, I.3).
- Pre-commit/pre-push hooks are recommended and documented for local enforcement.

### US-201: Work in Small, Incremental Batches
**As** a team member,
**I want** to integrate and release changes in small, frequent increments,
**So that** feedback is fast and risk is minimized.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All changes are integrated via short-lived branches or trunk-based development (see `.cicdrules.md` §I.2, II.10, II.11).
- The CI pipeline is triggered on every push/PR.

### US-202: Everyone is Responsible (Cross-Functional Teams)
**As** a project participant,
**I want** CI/CD success to be a shared responsibility,
**So that** quality, security, and delivery are team-wide concerns.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All roles (dev, test, ops, security) participate in pipeline design and review (see `.cicdrules.md` §I.4, XIII.80).
- Pipeline failures and improvements are discussed in retrospectives.

## II. Source Code Management & Version Control

### US-210: Version Control Everything
**As** a developer,
**I want** all project artifacts versioned in a single source of truth,
**So that** traceability and reproducibility are ensured.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All code, scripts, configs, docs, and IaC are in version control (see `.cicdrules.md` §II.9).

### US-211: Trunk-Based Development
**As** a developer,
**I want** to integrate code into the mainline frequently,
**So that** merge pain and integration risk are minimized.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Trunk/main is updated daily; branches are short-lived (see `.cicdrules.md` §II.10, II.11).
- Long-lived branches are discouraged and flagged.

**So that** changes are visible, reviewable, and versioned.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All pipeline configs are stored in version control (see `.cicdrules.md` §III.15).
- Pipeline changes require code review.

### US-221: Build Binaries Once, Promote Artifacts
**As** a build engineer,
**I want** to build artifacts once and promote them through environments,
**So that** integrity and traceability are preserved.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Binaries are built once per commit and versioned (see `.cicdrules.md` §IV.18, IV.19, IV.20).
- Artifacts are signed and stored in a managed repository.

### US-222: Automated Quality Gates
**As** a developer,
**I want** automated quality gates (tests, lint, security) enforced in CI,
**So that** only compliant code is merged.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Builds fail on test, lint, or security check failure (see `.cicdrules.md` §V.29, V.30).

- Commit-stage tests run in <10 minutes; flaky tests are eliminated.

### US-231: Shift Testing Left
**As** a developer,
**I want** to run tests as early as possible,
**So that** issues are found before code is merged.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Developers can run all tests locally (see `.cicdrules.md` §VI.33).
- CI enforces passing tests before merge.

### US-232: Test Data Management

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Gitleaks (or equivalent) scans all code on every push and PR.
- If secrets are found, the workflow fails and downstream jobs are blocked.
- The scan is documented in the workflow and traceability matrix.

---

## US-102: Fast Feedback on Build and Test Failures
