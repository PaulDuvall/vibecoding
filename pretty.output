Feature: Daily Digest Generation and Delivery # tests/features/digest_workflow.feature:1
  As a content consumer interested in AI and developer tools
  I want to receive a daily email digest with curated, summarized content
  So that I can stay updated on the latest developments efficiently
  Background:   # tests/features/digest_workflow.feature:6

  Scenario: US-001 US-003 - Complete daily digest workflow execution        # tests/features/digest_workflow.feature:11
    Given the system has valid API keys for OpenAI and SendGrid             # tests/features/steps/digest_steps.py:12
    And the recipient email is configured                                   # tests/features/steps/digest_steps.py:26
    And RSS feeds are accessible                                            # tests/features/steps/digest_steps.py:32
    Given multiple RSS feeds are available with recent content              # tests/features/steps/digest_steps.py:70
    And the OpenAI API is responding normally                               # tests/features/steps/digest_steps.py:77
    And SendGrid email service is operational                               # tests/features/steps/digest_steps.py:91
    When the daily digest generation process is executed                    # tests/features/steps/digest_steps.py:99
    Then content should be fetched from all configured RSS feeds            # tests/features/steps/digest_steps.py:170
    And articles should be summarized using OpenAI with Paul Duvall's voice # tests/features/steps/digest_steps.py:189
    And a properly formatted HTML email should be generated                 # tests/features/steps/digest_steps.py:220
    And the email should be sent successfully via SendGrid                  # tests/features/steps/digest_steps.py:242
    And the email subject should include the current date in Eastern Time   # tests/features/steps/digest_steps.py:254
    And the email should contain content from multiple sources              # tests/features/steps/digest_steps.py:266
    And each article should include source attribution and links            # tests/features/steps/digest_steps.py:275
